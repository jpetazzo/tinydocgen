# Memorandum Of Understanding


## Purpose

This defines the conditions in which {{ provider }} will
provide training services to {{ customer }}.

Here is the full address and contact information of {{ provider }}:

*{{ provider_full | replace("\n", "  \n") | trim }}*

Here is the full address and contact information of {{ customer }}:

*{{ customer_full | replace("\n", "  \n") | trim }}*

{{ provider }} will provide the following course:

*{{ course_short_description | trim }}*

A longer description is attached as a separate document.

The course will be delivered in {{ course_language }}.
The course materials will be in English.

The course can have up to {{ students }} students.

{% if course_online %}

The course will be delivered online, through a live
video streaming platform.

{% else %}

The course will take place at the following address:

*{{ course_address | replace("\n", "  \n") | trim }}*

{% endif %}

The course will take place at the following time:

*{{ course_date }}*

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Responsibilities of {{ provider }}

{{ provider }} will provide an instructor
{%- if assistants==1 %} and an assistant {% endif %}
{%- if assistants>=2 %} and {{ assistants }} assistants {% endif %}
to deliver the course.

Course materials (slides) will be hosted on a public website
available during the course and afterwards.

{% if course_online %}

{{ provider }} will set up and cover costs for the live video
streaming platform used to deliver the course. (The technical
requirements to access the video stream are detailed in the
next section.)

{% else %}

{{ provider }} will book and cover costs for travel and lodging
for the instructor
{%- if assistants==1 %} and assistant {%- endif -%}
{%- if assistants>=2 %} and assistants {%- endif -%}.

{% endif %}

For the duration of the course, each student will be given
access to a training environment hosted on cloud virtual machines.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Responsibilities of {{ customer }}

{% if course_online %}

{{ customer }} will make sure that each student has a computer
and internet connection.

During the online course, the students will need to access:

- the live video stream,
- one or multiple terminals with SSH connections to remote machines,
- a chat room for Q&A,
- a web browser to access course materials and deployed apps.

It is recommended to have either:

- a computer with a high resolution large screen (27" or above, 1440p or above),
- or a computer with dual monitors,
- or a computer + a tablet (the tablet being used to display the video stream).

The video stream is available through HLS and RTMP.
It can be viewed on a computer (Linux, Mac, Windows) using
a web browser (without installing additional software or plugins).
On some tablets, the HLS video stream may not function correctly.
In that case, installing the free app VLC (VideoLAN Client) will
allow to view the stream.

The video stream requires at least 500 kilobits/s, and optimal
quality is at 4 megabits/s.

{% else %}

{{ customer }} will provide the venue where the course will take place.

The room should have at least one video projector or screen, to
be used by the instructor to present the course materials and demos.
The projector or screen must offer direct HDMI connectivity.
Stay away from AirPlay, Chromecast, ClickShare, and similar systems
that require a specific operating system or driver installation.

The screen should be big enough to be readable by all attendees
in the room. As an example, here is a typical slide of content:

- https://kadm-2019-06.container.training/#28

The venue should be set up as a classroom: students should be able
to sit with their computer on a table, facing the screen.
Avoid meeting rooms arranged with a long table ("board room" style)
or a U-shaped table, as these do not offer good conditions for
a course.

The instructor will be standing while presenting. The room should
have a lectern, standing desk, or something similar allowing the
instructor to use their computer while standing.

Each student will use their own computer ({{ provider }} will not
provide computers for the students). There should be enough
power outlets for the students' computers since they will use
them during the entire training.

The venue should offer wireless or wired connectivity. The network
should allow unrestricted access to https://container.training/
and to the virtual machines used for the training. If the network
has specific filtering rules, {{ customer }} should discuss
with {{ provider }} to make sure that it will be possible
to access the training environments during the course.
